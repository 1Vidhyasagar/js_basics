✅ What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is the brain of a website.

HTML = Skeleton 🦴

CSS = Makeup 💄

JavaScript = Brain 🧠 that makes the site do things

Example: When you click a button and a popup comes → that’s JavaScript.

📦 Variables: Like Dabbas (Boxes)
You store stuff in variables:

js
Copy
Edit
let name = "Sagar";
const age = 29;
var city = "Bangalore"; // (Old-style)
let = reusable dabba (you can change the item inside)

const = sealed dabba (you can’t change it)

var = old style dabba (we avoid this now)

🧪 Data Types (Kinds of Dabba Contents)
Type	Example	Meaning
String	"hello"	Text inside quotes
Number	42	Any number
Boolean	true/false	Yes/No questions
Null	null	Empty dabba, intentionally
Undefined	undefined	You forgot to put item inside

➕ Operators
js
Copy
Edit
let a = 5 + 2;       // 7 (Addition)
let b = "Hi " + "there"; // "Hi there" (String join)
🔀 Conditions (if/else)
js
Copy
Edit
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote");
} else {
  console.log("Sorry, wait more");
}
🧠 Think of it like:
"If you're 18+, allow voting. Else, deny."

🧠 Memory Trick:
JS = Jugaadu Script – it does everything.

Want to click? It clicks.

Want to calculate? It calculates.

Want to throw popup? It throws! 🎉
